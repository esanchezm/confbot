If there is anything you feel needs to be done but you either don't have time or don't know how add an entry, with your name, to this file.

If you finish a TODO make sure to remove the entry from this file.

In /nick, we need to offer a way to limit the number of regestered nicks a user can have. [Pakttack161]

Add a user definable limit to how long a user can receive messages without sending anyway (a.k.a. going inactive). This is an attempt to increase the time large bots have before Google labels them as "spamming" and blocks them for 24 hours. - [Pakattack161]

Add more options to /anick. I'm looking to add the ability to register nicks, change a nick outside of the normal boundries, and lock nicks. - [Pakattack161]
