NOTICE: Remember that this is the Trunk version (No, there is no Stable, yet) so there are bound to be some bugs. If you find any please email hawk.mckain (at) gmail (dot) com with the details about the bug.

For change logs from 09/05 (when it was originally being worked on), look towards the end of the file.

2006/08/08
	[Added]
	-Hawkchat feature, which is a learning chatbot.
		Note: Main development is in English so it will be smartest
		if spoken to in English.
		
		Also Note: Hawkchat is still in it's beta stages and will
		only respond to "Hawk:" Leave 
		
		Again Note: Most of hawkchat is in hawkchat.py and at the end
		of messageCB with the message modifiers.
		
	[Fixed]
	-/quit now properly removes a user from the bot.
		Changed: getdisplayname to getcleanname in "boot".
		
	-syntax error in the function hawkchat()

2006/07/30
	[Updated]
	-The message filter now does a better job at filtering.
		Note: It won't filter between words but it still needs work.
	
	[Fixed]
	-/mute now sends a message to everyone about the muted user.

2006/07/27
	[Added]
	-MSN Users can now use /msgform to toggle the message format from 
		"<Username> Says:
			<Message>"
		to
		"<Username> <Message>"
		
	[Updated]
	-/names shows number of online, offline, and away, with the total
	
	[Fixed]
	-A typo in the default welcome message that was causing errors
		when a user joined the bot.

2006/07/19
	[Fixed]
	-/kick and /ban for a change I had made but never reverted.
	
	-Logging now properly logs the <timestamp> <Nickname> <Message>
	
2006/07/17
	[Updated]
	-/status no longer puts the status in lower case.
	
	-/nick now encodes nicknames with strange characters in them into utf7.
		Note: They still don't get decoded properly, so don't try it just yet.

2006/07/14
	[Updated]
	-Now as long as there is the word "silent" anywhere after /away it will
		not send a message to the room you went away. Once you've gone away
		silently you'll automatically come back silently with /away.
		
		It adds the user flag 'silent' if the user goes away silently.
		
	[Fixed]
	-Fixed a major bug in the updated message system that was preventing
		any commands that used sendtoall to work properly.
		
		sendtoall now checks to see if msgname exists and sets it to None
		after it sends all the messages to prevent false names in the logs.

2006/07/10
	[Updated]
	-MessageCB and sendtoall to format the messages that get sent to MSN
		users to make it look more like a MSN chatroom.
		
		Note: Now it just sends the msg through sendtoall and stores the user
			name in "msgname".
		

2006/07/05
	[Updated]
	-getdisplayname() now properly displays nicknames from MSN transports.
	
	-/names won't list a "person" who's email address doesn't have a '@' in it.
		(Blocks transports from being shown.)
	
	[Fixed]
	-Made /info a cmd and got it to display the text through systoone.
		The fix was that it was incomplete and errored when trying to
		get the resource for the user. That's been comented out now.
	
2006/07/02
	[Updated]
	-It now displays the users nick when they go away and come back.

2006/06/30
	[Added]
	-Nigger is now one of the default words filtered.
	
	[Updated]
	-The title for the .bat now shows as "Google Talk: Conference Bot"
	
	[Fixed]
	-Fixed a bug with /reload which was trying to pass an argument to cuss_list
	
	[Misc]
	-Started uploading a new messages.pot with each revision.

2006/06/29
	[Added]
	-has_flag, add_flag, del_flag. However at the moment they only
		modify conf.general.
	
	-Added the exception "CUSS_COMMAND" which outputs: 
		"Please do not use foul language."
		
	-Users can now use /filterlist to display a list of filtered words.
		
	[Updated]
	-You can now use /away without a reason.
	
	-All cmds now get run through the langauge filter. 
		acmds don't at the moment. 
	
	-All acmds check for the admin in cmd instead of in each function.
	
	-/nick now changes msg into 
		msg.encode(locale.getdefaultlocale()[1],'replace')
		to prevent nicklist.ini corruption.
	
	[Fixed]
	-It won't send messages to people with the "away" flag anymore.

	[Misc]
	-/filter doesn't properly update each time a word is added or removed
		so a reboot is required for the changes to take effect.
	
2006/06/28
	[Updated]
	-Added a help option to /dice and clean up some of it's coding.

Most of the changes between revision 32 and 36 are here.
2006/06/08 - 2006/06/27
	[Added]
	-/nick which acts much like a nickserver in an IRC channel
		
		For more user information type /nick help.
		For more dev information check "command_docs.txt"
		
	-/anick which will allow admins to control other user's nicks.
		Currently can only unregester a nick.
	
	-/qna which stands for question and answer. When an admin
		types /qna it will ask the room a question similar to this:
			*** Question and Answer
			Who is the writer of _The Peace War_
		And the first person to have the answer, in this case "Vernor Vinge", 
		any where in their message gets 1 point added to their score.
	
		For more information check "command_docs.txt"
	
	-/dice. A simple command that allows users to roll up to
		20 dice with any number of sides.
		
		For more information type /dice help.
	
	-Function convert_seq to convert .ini keys into spaced strings. 
		If you want to do more than that with it you'll have to
		write your own modifiers.
		
		Example:
		['blue', 'green', 'school bus yellow'] -> blue green school bus yellow.
	
	-A language filter based off regexes. It allows admins to use * and []s
		in the filter. 
		Examples:
			fuc*k -> fuck or fuk
			mast[ue]rbate -> masterbate or masturbate
			
		"filtermask" in config.ini controls what it masks words with.
		while "wordfilter" is the list of words. As with all lists
		if the word has a space you need quotations ("") and make
		sure you add a comma (,) to the end.
		
		
	[Updated]
	-The version is now based directly off the SVN revision.
	
	-Renamed confbot.ini to config.ini.
	
	-getdisplayname() will return a nick of the jid run through it
		has one. If you need it to return the "Pattack161" part in
		"Pakattack161@gmail.com" then use getcleanname() instead.
	
	-getjid() returns a jid from a nickname. It also uses getcleanname()
	
	-By default logs now save in ../logs.
	
	[Fixed]
	-Fixed the log filepath so it'll make the dir if it doesn't exist
		and then alert the owner it did.
