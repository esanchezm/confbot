2006/06/27
	[Updated]
	-The version is now based directly off the SVN revision.

		wordfilters.

2006/06/26
	[Updated]
	-Rewrote /qna so it's clearer to the users in the room
		what exactly it is and it's easier to add new 
		categories of questions. 
		
		If you want to disable a category, under [QnA] change
			the 1 to a 0.
		
	-Removed the alerts for user's status changes for now.
		I'm having trouble adding a command to block those.
		
	-Transfered the changelog from inside confbot.py to here
		at the end of the file.
	
	[Fixed]
	-Fixed a typo in /nick that caused errors if a user tried
		to take a tempnick.
			
	-Fixed the log filepath so it'll make the dir if it doesn't
		previously exist and alert the user it has.

	[Misc]
	-The variable flag commands (eg. has_flag) is currently
		not working properly. Please don't use it just yet.
	
2006/06/16
	[Added]
	-The system will now display when a user logs on, 
		goes idle/busy, or goes offline.
		
		Note: Will add an option for users to disable
			this if they find it annoying.
			
		Wish: Allow a user to show when a certain other
			user logs on.

2006/06/13
	[Updated]
	-Users can use a nickname inplace of a JID in 
		commands like /msg and /whoid. 
	
	-Users can now type /nick list to see a list of
		nicknames currently used by someone and who's
		using it.
		
		Also /nick list online will display only the
		nicks of online users.
	
	-By default logs now save in ../logs.

2006/06/12
	[Added]

	[Updated]
	-You can now chnage what the langauge filter masks
		words with in confbot.ini under "filtermask".
		
	-/nick now stores regestered and temporarty nicks
		in lowercase so they can be compared in 'getjid'.
		
	-Updated 'getjid' to return a JID if a user types in 
		a nickname.
		
	-Renamed confbot.ini to config.ini for clarity.

2006/06/11
	[Added]
	-Function convert_seq to convert .ini keys into 
		spaced strings.
	-/wordfilter to add and delete filtered words.
		To add a word like fuck where you want to filter
		both fuck and fuk add an asterisk (*) after the
		c so it would look like this: fuc*k.
	
	[Updated] 
	-Made some improvements to the language filter
		-It now reads from confbot.ini.
		-It will automatically filter spaced words.
			(eg. f u c k)
		-Minor optimazations.
	-Made some improvements to Questions and Answers
		-/qna now reads from Games.ini.
		-When adding a new category besure to open
			confbot.py and search for "QnA Categories"
			then add ', QnA.get("<category>")' to
			the end of both "qu" and "an".
			
			Make sure you put the Questions in "qu" 
			and Answers in "an".
		
	[Fixed]
	-/qna now properly stops listening for answers
		after someone wins.
	
2006/06/10
