2006/06/28
	[Updated]
	-Added a help option to /dice and clean up some of it's coding.

Most of the changes between revision 32 and 36 are here.
2006/06/08 - 2006/06/27
	[Added]
	-/nick which acts much like a nickserver in an IRC channel
		
		For more user information type /nick help.
		For more dev information check "command_docs.txt"
		
	-/anick which will allow admins to control other user's nicks.
		Currently can only unregester a nick.
	
	-/qna which stands for question and answer. When an admin
		types /qna it will ask the room a question similar to this:
			*** Question and Answer
			Who is the writer of _The Peace War_
		And the first person to have the answer, in this case "Verno Vinge", 
		any where in their message gets 1 point added to their score.
	
		For more information check "command_docs.txt"
	
	-/dice. A simple command that allows users to roll up to
		20 dice with any number of sides.
		
		For more information type /dice help.
	
	-Function convert_seq to convert .ini keys into spaced strings. 
		If you want to do more than that with it you'll have to
		write your own modifiers.
		
		Example:
		['blue', 'green', 'school bus yellow'] -> blue green school bus yellow.
	
	-A language filter based off regexes. It allows admins to use * and []s
		in the filter. 
		Examples:
			fuc*k -> fuck or fuk
			mast[ue]rbate -> masterbate or masturbate
			
		"filtermask" in config.ini controls what it masks words with.
		while "wordfilter" is the list of words. As with all lists
		if the word has a space you need quotations ("") and make
		sure you add a comma (,) to the end.
		
		
	[Updated]
	-The version is now based directly off the SVN revision.
	
	-Renamed confbot.ini to config.ini.
	
	-getdisplayname() will return a nick of the jid run through it
		has one. If you need it to return the "Pattack161" part in
		"Pakattack161@gmail.com" then use getcleanname() instead.
	
	-getjid() returns a jid from a nickname. It also uses getcleanname()
	
	-By default logs now save in ../logs.
	
	[Fixed]
	-Fixed the log filepath so it'll make the dir if it doesn't exist
		and then alert the owner it did.
