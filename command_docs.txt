Nick(/nick):	
	The command /nick which acts much like a nickserver in an IRC channel
		only this one users the person's email as their password. It also
		is pretty safe from name stealing since Names are not allowed to
		have spaces, underscores, or asterisks in them and get capitalized
		to eliminate cap abusers.
		
		/nick uses three sections in nicklist.ini:
			[tempnick] is used to store nicks when use an unregistered nick.
				Only unregestered nicks that are -in use- will get put here.
				Once a user changes their nick or regesters one it will erase
				the entry here.
			[nickname] stores the email and the currently used nick. This
				is used by "getdisplayname" to speed up the search process.
			[nickreg] stores all nicks that get registered. Entries in this
				section are only removed if a user, or admin, unregisters it.
			
Question and Answer (/qna):
	When an admin types /qna it will ask the room a question similar to this:
		*** Question and Answer
		Who is the writer of _The Peace War_
	And the first person to have the answer, in this case "Verno Vinge", 
	any where in their message gets 1 point added to their score.
	
	If you want to add new questions you can do so in Games.ini by
	adding the question to the end of the category you want. If it has 
	a space in it surround it in quotation marks ("") and make sure you
	add a comma (,) at the end of each one.

	To add new categories you'll need to add the name of your category
	to each section (eg. [Ps]).
	Here is a short run down of what each is for:
		[QnA] This is the list that the command uses to know what categories 
			there are and which to use. If you want to disable one simply change 
			the 1 to a 0. 
		[Ps] This is the prefix, or "Who is the writer of" part of the question.
			(Note: Don't worry about spaces at the end, they get added in later.)
		[Qs] This is where the actual question, or "_The Peace War_" is.
			(Note: Make sure all new categories begin with a blank "question")
		[As] This is where the answers, or "Vernor Vinge" goes. 
			(Note: They need to be in the same "slot" as the question or your users 
			will never get any thing right.)
			(Also Note: At this time the system does not support multipul answers.)
			
	The list of Questions and Answers included is just an example to show
	what it should look like so if you're not sure how it works take a look
	at the QnAs already in there.
