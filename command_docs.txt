Nick(/nick):	
	The command /nick which acts much like a nickserver in an IRC channel
		only this one users the person's email as their password. It also
		is pretty safe from name stealing since Names are not allowed to
		have spaces, underscores, or asterisks in them and get capitalized
		to eliminate cap abusers.
		
		/nick uses three sections in nicklist.ini:
			[tempnick] is used to store nicks when use an unregistered nick.
				Only unregestered nicks that are -in use- will get put here.
				Once a user changes their nick or regesters one it will erase
				the entry here.
			[nickname] stores the email and the currently used nick. This
				is used by "getdisplayname" to speed up the search process.
			[nickreg] stores all nicks that get registered. Entries in this
				section are only removed if a user, or admin, unregisters it.
